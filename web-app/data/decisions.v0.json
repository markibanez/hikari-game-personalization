Kira and Jin arrive just as you begin your descent.They throw themselves at you, sending the four of you to the ground with a crash. As they attempt to tear the scroll free from your grasp you recall the phrase written in the scoll... Just as they are about to prise it from your grip you scream out the phrase. Immediately you send a blast of swirling wind outward, picking everyone else up like children and tossing them clear. Adrenaline pumping, you peer through the settling dust and see Kibu sprawled out on the track below, nursing a bruised head. You pick yourself up off the ground and scamper down to help him up. An uncomfortable silence falls between you both on the long walk home... What the hell did you just do?",

Instantly a blast of wind radiates out from him, sending dust and leaves in a flurry along the alley way. WHOAAA!! Kibu yells. You glance down at the scroll and read the phrase aloud.
